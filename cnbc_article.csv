"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."
"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"

(Plus a few special guest appearances from friends reporting ""on the ground.""),We hope you enjoyed following along with us during ,. Read on for some of the night's biggest laughs, our loudest groans and a (hopefully) delightful smattering of quips, digs and analysis.,In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. ,I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable., this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win.

"In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. "
"I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable."
" this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” "
"The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors."
"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011.

Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies.

That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."

The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking.

"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."

"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."

But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."

What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable., this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019.

Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier.

While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors."
"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."
", continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. "
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017. He didn't show up in 2018 or 2019 either; ,, though. ,And the dinner was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid pandemic.,Many Washington insiders affectionately refer to the dinner as ""Nerd Prom"" — though the nickname has been ,. "
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."

Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. ,I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences.

Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us.

Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about.

As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary.

It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick.

Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed.,Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier.

"In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person.

Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. "
"I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience.

But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."
", continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. "
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017.

"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."

Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed.,Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier.

"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s.

Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day.

""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies.

"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."

"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."
"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."

[Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"

(Plus a few special guest appearances from friends reporting ""on the ground.""),We hope you enjoyed following along with us during ,. Read on for some of the night's biggest laughs, our loudest groans and a (hopefully) delightful smattering of quips, digs and analysis.,In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. ,I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable., this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed.,Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. ,The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk.,The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017. He didn't show up in 2018 or 2019 either; ,, though. ,And the dinner was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid pandemic.,Many Washington insiders affectionately refer to the dinner as ""Nerd Prom"" — though the nickname has been ,. "
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."
"In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. "
"I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable."
" this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” "
"The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors."
"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."
", continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking.

A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017.

"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."

"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does.

[Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"

It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences.

But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed.,Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier.

"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

(Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."

The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. "

But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. ,I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable., this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters.

So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed.,Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. ,The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk.,The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017. He didn't show up in 2018 or 2019 either; ,, though. ,And the dinner was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid pandemic.,Many Washington insiders affectionately refer to the dinner as ""Nerd Prom"" — though the nickname has been ,. "
"In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. "
"I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable."
" this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” "
"The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors."
"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt.

President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win.

"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic.

She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed.

Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,.

"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."
", continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. "
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017. He didn't show up in 2018 or 2019 either; ,, though. ,And the dinner was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid pandemic.,Many Washington insiders affectionately refer to the dinner as ""Nerd Prom"" — though the nickname has been ,. "
"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."

"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."

"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have viewed the public health measures taken to stop the disease’s spread with suspicion if not outright scorn. In response, we’ve seen the GOP’s members ,, scoff at the , and at times ,.,There is, however, , Republicans loved, despite no evidence that it has had a major impact on the course of the pandemic: a rule known as Title 42. And now they’re willing to risk federal funding for every other Covid response to protect it — or at least try to embarrass Democrats in the process.,Earlier this year, the White House warned Congress that the federal government was , to pay for free Covid tests and vaccines. Republicans scoffed and , for how past Covid money had been spent, a request that caused additional pandemic funding to be left out of the major spending package Congress passed in March.,Last month, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced they’d come to a deal to , for Covid prevention and treatment efforts. Half of that money would go toward “the development and purchase of therapeutics — potentially eliminating the need for future vaccine and mask mandates,” , at the time.,Schumer , that while the package didn’t include the $5 billion in international Covid aid Democrats wanted, it would nonetheless “give the federal government — and our citizens — the tools we need to continue our economic recovery, keep schools open and keep American families safe.”,It should have been a slam dunk win for bipartisanship, an example of each side giving a little for the greater good. But between then and now, some Senate Republicans saw an opportunity.,Under the Trump administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented the public health rule, which allowed border officials to turn back anyone seeking to claim asylum in the United States. The rule was developed with the theory that a clampdown on the border was needed to stop the spread of an infectious disease. About , are immediately turned back every day thanks to the rule, a number that is expected to increase if Title 42 is lifted and prompts more migrants to attempt the crossing.,But ,, after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security, that “suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary.” And so the administration plans to lift the order as of May 23.,Republicans find the idea that America would actually go back to the immigration rules from March 2020 infuriating. In response, Senate Republicans are now “filibustering the bipartisan Covid relief bill unless the Democratic-controlled chamber votes on an amendment to reimpose” Title 42, ,.,Republicans clearly see holding the Covid money hostage as a win-win: Either the money doesn’t get spent, which is no skin off their nose, despite the deaths it could prevent; the Democrats hold the vote and the GOP’s amendment passes, providing them a policy win; or the amendment fails, and Republicans get to harangue Democrats who voted against it in campaign ads ahead of the midterms.,Senate Democrats are considering tying the Covid package to Biden’s requested ,, a cause that both parties actually support. But Republicans are wary about any linkage. Even Romney told NBC News that he believes “the prospects of each being passed would be greater if they were kept separate, and if each had the potential for amendments.” (Way to go to bat for your bill, Mitt.),Nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions.,Even if the GOP’s amendment does pass the Senate, it would then have to go to the House, where Republicans are even less likely to vote in favor of the Covid spending. House Democrats would also find voting to put Title 42 back into place anathema, especially given that there’s no public health argument for doing so.,That last point is key because, as you may have noticed, nowhere have I mentioned Republicans making the case that there is a public health argument for keeping Title 42’s restrictions. Instead, the GOP has been stoking fears of a surge in migration at the border that some have , That rhetoric has always played well, and Democrats have never really challenged it, instead constantly operating inside , framework.,It’s not really surprising, then, to see the Republicans’ priorities laid so starkly bare. There’s no concern about a new variant of Covid popping up, no worries about what happens if Americans need another booster shot of the vaccine. But the idea that brown people might exercise their legal right to seek safety from violence and oppression? That’s something that has to be stopped even it means more people here already getting sick and dying."

It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences.

But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors.,My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said.,This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good.,And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!,""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington.,Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP.,Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties.,So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN.,So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. ,CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. ,Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!,Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”,Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you.,There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped.,“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”,There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. ,Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!,I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?,Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. ,We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance.,Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,., — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. ,The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case.

""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019.

Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe.

It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET.,, continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier.

"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt.

When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners!

"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011. President Barack Obama was in rare form that night, as he,: Donald Trump.,Trump had been floating the idea of running for president — , — but nobody thought there was a chance he’d actually do it, let alone win. Either way, part of Trump’s renewed push for political relevancy involved spreading,, and Obama had had enough. Here’s how McKay Coppins, who wrote in 2016 about,, described Obama’s decision to go after Trump — and the billionaire’s reaction:,While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the night of humiliation gave Trump the push he needed to actually run for president,… I think it definitely helped."
"“Listen, the president is the people's president, the people's leader. The press is the people’s information source,” said actress Sophia Bush (no, not , Bushes) from the WHCD red carpet:,“And when we begin to attack and denigrate what the press does, what you all do  — when we begin to act as though being at an event like this, and heralding the work of journalists around the world doesn't matter — democracy hangs in the balance because democracy only exists with the truth. So I think it's about time the most powerful man in the world showed up to honor the press. And you know, maybe it's because we have a president who likes democracy again, that we're here.”"
"There’s an excitement tonight that I just have not felt in the past two White House Correspondents’ Dinners that I have attended. It’s like people coming back to school from summer break — but two years later. There's just a truly , joy in the room. People want to talk to each other and catch up. Plus, they want to laugh. "
"Some of us (and perhaps also you, dear reader), came of age at a time when the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was one of the social events of the year in Washington. As a recent college grad living in the city, I was of the many people, and all of the events surrounding it.,But I realized this year that I had no idea where the nickname came from. It turns out that up until 2009, the phrase was used mostly to refer to,. This was during the early days of the Obama administration and the rapid rise of Twitter among D.C.’s wonk class.,According to my tireless research, I’ve tracked the popularization of “Nerd Prom” to,, a legend among the blogging masses, who used it in a conversation with journalist Patrick Gavin and Christina Bellantoni. From her, it spread to Chris Cillizza,,, and then the world via the hashtag #nerdprom. By the day after the 2009 dinner, NBC News’ Chris Jansing declared in her report that “inside the beltway, it's known as the nerd prom,” as though it had been called that for decades.,By 2010, the nickname was indeed everywhere, spawning backlash by those who argued the,! Between the Trump administration’s, and the pandemic, the event’s luster had definitely dimmed from its heyday — but now, for better or worse, the prom is back, as one of MSNBC’s Twitter followers excitedly declared:,THE NERD PROM IS BAAAAAAAAACK!"
"I'll be honest; I mostly loathe the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I think many people think journalists and politicians are too cozy, and it doesn't do much to assuage the conspiracy theories when you see them all in a room together, partying down. In 2011, the year Osama bin Laden was killed, the political press was mostly, when it happened, so the people who ended up breaking the news were...,, and Donald Rumsfeld staffer Keith Urbahn. ,I was the editor-in-chief of the New York Observer that year and as a matter of policy, I wouldn't let our reporters attend. But I did let them report on the parties and craziness around it. That year they reported it as the bin Laden operation was happening, and this was the resulting story: , ,It felt like the people who , have been covering it missed it because they were at the dinner.,But that said, I am glad to see that we are back to a place where we don't have a thin-skinned president who can't tolerate the kind of skewering the chief executive always gets. Is that normalcy? Kind of?"
"Tonight marks the first time in several years that an , — and it’s a more significant event than many may think. In other nations, comedians can’t joke about their leader. I should know — I performed stand-up comedy across the Middle East. And one of the main rules is no jokes about the king, sheik, president, or whatever title the leader goes by. ,But this has not been true in the United States, where presidents for decades have attended this conclave of journalists, knowing that they would be the target of comedic barbs. ,Donald Trump — who famously was , by both President Obama and NBC’s Seth Meyers — refused to attend the event while in office. What does this tell us? It seems Trump has more in common with kings and dictators than American presidents; like so many of them, he prefers to be feared — not laughed at. "
"We already know a number of the award recipients who are being honored at tonight’s event. ,In the “Overall Excellent in White House Coverage” category, Jonathan Swan of Axios won for his coverage of the Trump White House. (Remember back in 2020, when Trump responded to a question about ,? Swan conducted that interview). ,In the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for broadcast, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl won for his coverage of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And in the “Excellent in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure” category for print, Associated Press reporters Zeke Miller and Mike Balsamo won for their 2021 report on the CDC easing up on its mask-wearing guidance."
"Shoutout to the Marine Corps band, which is the main musical guest for tonight’s dinner. As diners began to feast, the band played the, which is about as rocking a good time as it sounds. It has to be one of the perks of the putting on this shindig that you know that you can always book a band that’s up for playing,."
" — not to mention the celebrity appearances — are going to get the most attention tonight. But don’t forget: They give out awards at this thing, too! Notably, this is the first year the White House Correspondents' Association will be giving out lifetime achievement awards. , is named after the first two Black women to serve in the White House press corps. Alice Dunnigan became the first Black woman to get her White House press credentials in 1947, and was followed soon after by Ethel Payne. (And Dunnigan and Payne are the award's inaugural winners.),Dunnigan reported for the Associated Negro Press; Payne reported for the Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper. Both were often marginalized by White House officials who feared their pointed questions about racial inequality. "
"The annual , has experienced its share of highs and lows over the years, from poignant speeches to cringeworthy jokes, eyebrow-raising outfits and more. Here are just a few of the most noteworthy (recent) moments:,In 1992, comedian Paula Poundstone became the first woman to headline the event. Four other women have had the honor since then: Elayne Boosler, ,, , and Michelle Wolf.,The event ""did not feel like a normal gig to me,"" Poundstone , in 2015. ""There was a real kind of fairytale quality to a lot of it."",In 2011, then-President Barack Obama famously skewered Donald Trump, star of ""Celebrity Apprentice"" and a central figure in the birtherism movement — a racist conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama wasn't born in the United States.,“Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,” Obama said. “And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"",Many political experts believe the mockery inspired Trump's presidential aspirations, though Trump denies that's the case. ""I had the greatest time,"" he ,. He's also never met a negative story he couldn't spin.,From 2011 ,: President Obama's jokes about Donald Trump.,Full video here: , ,Obama's final White House Correspondents' Dinner as president produced ,still beloved by Boomers to this day. (Or is my mom the only who keeps using this GIF in texts?!),""I want to close my final White House correspondents’ dinner by just saying thank you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""I’m very proud of what you’ve done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy."",""With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out,"" he concluded before literally dropping his microphone, setting the internet ablaze.,Wolf's performance caused a frenzy among political and media figures who argued over whether, aimed at then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders were inappropriate.,""I actually really like Sarah,"" Wolf said. ""I think she’s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she’s born with it; maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies."",Angry senior Trump administration officials boycotted the event in 2019. They may or may not have been missed."
"Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central, is the first comedian to headline the event since ,. ,Wolf's set was polarizing, with some finding , too cutting — and others ,. Nonetheless, the WHCA chose historian Ron Chernow as its featured speaker in 2019. That was a different vibe. The group apparently hoped to avoid another controversial entertainment program and deliver instead what Chernow described as ""a 20-minute sedative."",Hopefully, Trevor Noah won't be putting attendees to sleep. It will certainly be a friendly audience. Steven Portnoy, CBS News Radio’s White House correspondent and WHCA president, called Noah ""an incredible talent who keeps us laughing — and thinking — four nights a week."",Noah is expected to take the stage after dinner around 9:30 p.m. ET."
", continuing a decades-old tradition , when he skipped the dinner during his presidency.,The WHCA announced the Bidens' planned attendance as reports swirled of , days earlier. The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking. He will be the first president to give a speech at the event since ,. "
"The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017.

But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. ,I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable., this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” ,The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,.

"In , published Friday, Dr. Esther Choo warned that President Biden has a ""decent chance"" of being in the same room at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with a Covid-infected person. But it's not just high-profile Washingtonians who are at risk — it's service workers, too.,Choo wrote:,Will the White House Correspondents Dinner end up being a Gridiron II? Regardless, it could be safer for everyone— including those for whom the individual risk calculator doesn’t work ,Trevor Noah also mentioned the risks in his monologue. But with the dinner ended and attendees scattered into the night to continue the party, all we can do now is wait and see (and test!) Stay safe out there, nerds. "
"I expected “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah to be good tonight. But I didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did at his set, despite clearly being part of his target audience. (My favorite gag of the night? His riff on ,, featuring Kellyanne Conway.),Trevor Noah at the WHCA: “It is risky making jokes these days. I mean, we all saw what happened at the Oscars. I’ve actually been a little worried about tonight. What if I make a really mean joke about Kellyanne Conway… and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?”,Before taking the stage, President Biden informed Noah that unlike in Moscow, he was free to make fun of the president without getting arrested. It’s a point that Noah separately made in his bit — after several digs at the president, that is.,Some highlights: Noah’s speculating that he was chosen because Biden gets his “highest approval ratings” when, is standing next to” him; his assurance that things are “looking up” under Biden — , and that Russian President Vladimir Putin calmed down after, because “none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.”,It’s a privilege Noah clearly doesn’t take for granted, his ability to stand on stage next to the leader of a country and mock him with no consequences. And the comedian implored the journalists sitting in the Washington Hilton’s ballroom to do the same; to really take advantage of the freedom that the media is given in the U.S. to question authority and speak truth — even when it makes people uncomfortable."
" this year due to Covid concerns — but he seemed to be one of very few people in D.C. this weekend concerned about the pandemic. Despite constant reminders of the pandemic's shadow — and mentions in both President Biden's and Trevor Noah's remarks — there were barely any masks spotted on the red carpet.,""Young Sheldon"" star Iain Armitage was something of an anomaly, sporting double KN95 masks due to immunocompromised family members. “I trust that they are doing an amazing job and everyone is vaccinated and tested,” Armitage told NBC News. “It never hurts to have a little extra protection … With the COVID stuff, I am the original germaphobe.”,“I think we've reached a point where we realize it's gonna be with us,” said comedian Lesley Jordan. “And we can't stop. The world can't stop. I like the fact that it's on each of us. If you feel better wearing a mask, then wear a mask.”,The “Nanny” was also leaving her chances to protocols and fate.,“I take very good care of my body, I honor my immune system to support my body,” said actress Fran Drescher. “I know that everybody here passed the antigen test and is vaccinated, so I guess that’s as good as we can hope for and the rest is up to the Gods.”,And comedian Billy Eichner seemed to channel the sentiments of many at the party when he said that while the pandemic is still definitely underway, it’s time to live life again.,“I’ll get a booster every day if that’s what it takes,” he said. “I love being boosted. But you gotta get back to life. These are our lives. Life is short. And so you have to be cautious, you have to be safe — do the best you can to keep everyone safe. But I’m happy to be back. You can’t be stuck in your house forever.” "
"The WHCD is a fairly liberal (and incestuous) D.C. affair. Thus it was very fitting that Trevor Noah made sure to point out one of the biggest hurdles facing Democrats this year: other Democrats. ,Noah joked, for example, that he was nervous being in such close proximity to the most important decision-maker in the country: ,. (That got a chuckle out of President Biden.) The ,, and her signature stonewalling weren’t left unscathed either. “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican,” Noah said in an unsubtle nod to Sinema’s unsubtle obstruction of progressive reforms like the ,. While Noah was tough on Biden, he seemed to take equal if not more pleasure going after his defectors."
"My colleague Liz Plank already shared some of the ,, but he saved some of his most cutting Fox-related remarks for primetime host Sean Hannity and the network’s ,“Fun fact: , are actually dating now,” Noah said, referencing an alleged relationship between the two Fox News personalities. “I actually think it’s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that won’t end in a $20 million settlement.” That was a reference to the , after she sued Ailes over harassment claims. ,“I’m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, he’s looking up and smiling,” Noah said."
"This year's dinner felt markedly different than it did during the Trump era because the comedians and participants had more room to talk about where the , has failed than where the , has failed. Biden doesn't manufacture multiple crises a day the way President Trump did, so Trevor Noah rolled through all of the standard criticisms — that Biden’s very very old, that we have too much inflation, that he coasted off Obama, etc. — and then had to turn to the other people in the room for material. ,I generally think press criticism is healthy, and making fun of an outlet for pulling punches or being too cozy with the people it covers is a kind of accountability. The WHCD specifically is a little too insider-y for most people to get or care about. But the people in the room do get it — and being told they’re lazy or corrupted or willing to pull punches or too cozy with their sources in front of hundreds of their peers isn’t exactly fun. ,Also: Noah was funny. As ,, some of the night’s earlier material seemed to be journalists writing jokes (which is very bad and should never happen — journalists are not funny) instead of the comedians writing jokes. Noah's stuff was actually good."
"And now, for what (so many) were waiting for. ""My name is Trevor Noah, and I am really honored to be here,"" began ""The Daily Show"" host, before launching into a rollicking monologue that poked fun at the president, the press, Congress, Covid-19 and members of the Biden White House. ,It's good to be back, baby!"
"""Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,"" President Biden says at the ,'s , honoring journalism in Washington."
"Okay, I see you, Joe. President Biden worked himself into a nice rhythm during his stand-up set. I particularly appreciated his dig at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. ,”I’m not really here to roast the GOP. That’s not my style,” Biden noted. “Besides: there’s nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn’t already put on tape.” Pretty good jab there over , in which the Republican leader is heard criticizing some of the more extremist lawmakers in the GOP."
"Some of President Biden’s most effective jokes jabbed at Fox News reporters for well… not encouraging their viewers to get the jab. ""They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them,” he said to roaring applause. The camera panned to a few of the several Fox News reporters in the room. Did any of them find it funny? I'll report back after tonight's parties."
"So far tonight, we are zero for two on the gag videos that have been screened at the dinner. The first featured, trying to get a job at the White House and being sent out as press secretary. I can only assume that the White House reporters sitting in the Brady Press Room for this bit had either been bullied into taking part or promised that the tape would never actually see the light of day.,Then we had Billy Eichner, in a bit of inspired product placement for ,, present a salute to entertainment reporters. It was…fine? The joke, I think, was that entertainment journalists are bad at being real journalists and don’t really have the same challenges as Serious Political Reporters. Really spicy stuff, this.,Do I know exactly who to blame for this? No — but I have a hunch. See, journalists (myself included) tend to think that we are far, far funnier than we actually are. And I’d bet that member of the WHCA, not Eichner or Corden, wrote those bits. This demonstration of the ,would be apparent in most cases, but it really shows at an event like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where the jokes from everyone but the headliner tend to be about as entertaining as you’d expect from C-SPAN."
"So here's one of the few good things about the WHCD: It recognizes good student journalists and brings a handful of them to the dinner. I teach in the journalism school at NYU and student journalists do a lot of important work that gets picked up by major outlets (sometimes with no credit). Recognizing the real work they do is one of the better things the correspondents' association does. It's so nice to see the next generation of journalists being recognized and encouraged, especially in an environment that's increasingly hostile to journalists. "
"CBS icon Gayle King praised President Joe Biden for his handling of the Covid-19 testing at the WHCD, but her speech will likely be remembered more for giving us a definitive celebrity name for attendees Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.,After asking her teleprompter operator to pause so that she could riff, King confidently referred to them as “Kete.” Entertainment Tonight seems to have first ,, but for (perhaps) obvious reasons it did not stick. Until now. "
"Let’s keep it all the way real: Seeing the worlds of politics, activism and entertainment cross streams in this setting is pretty interesting, weird — and probably the best part of this entire event. Some of my favorite encounters and sightings? “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson linked up with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. I can’t begin to imagine what they discussed. ,Also, rapper Fat Joe was spotted chopping it up with Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Capitol Police Sgt. Harry Dunn, who testified before Congress about ,, is in there vibing, too. As is Fran Drescher of “The Nanny” fame!"
"Sheryl Lee Ralph, one of the ,had this to say tonight about the importance of the press: ,“I'm very happy we have this event coming back because around the world, journalists, certain media outlets have been vilified. It's got to stop. There are so many people who have trained, worked hard to deliver the news… Stop trying to tell us that journalism is bad. When that happens, something deeper is going on in the country and that must be stopped. And things must change. Tonight is all about good journalists, good journalism, great media and the work that they do, and I'm here to be in their company and applaud them.”"
"Coachella was back with a post(ish)-pandemic bang this year and so is the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Two very different events, for sure. But they also share more than you might think. ,Both were making splashy returns from an hiatus (though a ,). Both (yes, both!) tend to be magnets for celebrities and influencers. I mean, Hollywood’s new it couple Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson even showed up this year. ,Both events even have headliners! Iconic musical guests like Patti Page, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra have performed at the dinner (though female musicians were ,). Then there’s the outfits. While I didn’t spot any flower crowns on the red carpet, there were some spectacular looks. (No word yet if anyone pulled up to the dinner ,.),And just like Coachella this year, while the official WCHD guest list is never revealed until the last minute, everyone hopes Covid-19 doesn’t show up. A negative Covid test has been required for all attendees at the dinner in an effort to contain the spread. Given that the music festival people reported developing a very scary thing called the “,,” perhaps organizers in Washington, D.C. are trying to prevent a “nerd prom flu.” Biden, we’re looking at you."
"There may have been no more history-changing White House Correspondents’ Dinner than the one held in 2011.

The Bidens did not attend that dinner, though several members of the president's cabinet — and dozens of other attendees — tested positive after the event.,The White House said President Biden will take extra precautions at the event, including skipping the dinner portion and potentially opting to wear a mask when not speaking.

"The White House Correspondents' Dinner has returned after a two-year hiatus due to the ,, but fears over transmission linger — and for good reason.,Just weeks earlier, , — an annual roast of Washington politicians and media figures — tested positive for Covid. It was a perfectly American superspreader event, , earlier this month.,Setting up for tonight. First , Dinner in three years. ,The roughly 2,600 WHCD attendees will reportedly have to , to be allowed inside the dinner.,But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, caused confusion this week when he declared the U.S. has moved beyond the Covid ""pandemic phase."" A day later, he said he was planning to skip the White House Correspondents' Dinner after making personal assessment about his own Covid risk."
"The , — beloved by some, loathed by others — is an annual gathering of journalists and politicos hosted by the White House Correspondents' Association. The group, , in response to President Woodrow Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the media, held its first dinner on May 7, 1921.,The first president to attend the event was President Calvin Coolidge in 1924. ,in 36 years when he opted not to attend in 2017.

"When Rachel Bouman, a Chicago-based C-suite coach for executive women, wrote a , to celebrate one year of being sober a few weeks ago, it was the first time she told anyone other than her husband and teenage daughter about her personal journey with alcohol.,“I wasn’t an alcoholic and never went to a 12-step program, yet I didn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. It had become the place I turned to numb, self-soothe or unwind. I knew I was doing it and wouldn’t stop,” Bouman wrote. Becoming sober helped her eliminate brain fog, munchies and even wrinkles.,As a result of her public admission, Bouman said she has been able to make valuable connections with women — and clients — who support her journey. Some of these women admitted that they have also “wrestled with” , or too often.,American alcohol consumption dramatically increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and women increased their , (consuming four or more drinks within a couple of hours) by 41 percent.,Moreover, alcohol has a greater effect on women’s bodies than on men’s. According to the ,, biological differences in body structure and chemistry cause women to absorb more alcohol and take longer to metabolize it, leading to more longer-term health effects than their male counterparts.,To regain control of their lives, women like Bouman are choosing to ,…and finding a surprising amount of professional success along the way.,But for Bouman, now 46, her greatest victory came after a friend recently urged her to try “just a sip” of hard cider. Bouman’s 14-year-old daughter proudly interjected: “My mama doesn’t drink — not even a sip.”,A century ago, men’s alcohol consumption outpaced women’s by a ratio of 3:1; today the ratio is closer to 1:1. According to a study done by the , men have been drinking the same amount — or less — while women have been drinking more.,But some women are hoping to reverse this trend.,“Alcohol is supposed to be a celebration substance. Alcohol is supposed to be a stress relieving substance. Alcohol is that thing that's there to make you feel better when nothing else does. And the reality is, is that's just putting a band-aid on whatever's going on underneath,” said 38-year-old ,, international curve model. She abandoned alcohol “cold turkey” in May of 2019.,Although Tice said that she never felt like she was “drinking too much,” she found herself “entrenched in ,.”,Tice recalled, “I got to this point that not only had a gained a lot of weight [from drinking], but I wasn’t able to be present. [Alcohol] was sucking a lot of joy out of my parenting experience.”,Drinking had been affecting Tice’s professional ambitions, as well. She had started writing a book at the end of 2018 but wasn’t making a lot of progress.,“It wasn't until I stopped drinking that I was able to get really clear on my goals and realize what I was capable of, because instead of spending time drinking, I was spending time writing,” said Tice. “I honestly don't think I would have finished this book if I had still been drinking.”,The resulting book, “,,” includes a chapter subtitled, “Why Alcohol is Not Your Friend,” in which she encourages women to look at how, when and why they consume alcohol.,“I operate much cleaner and with more reliability when I'm not drinking,” said Dawn Hunter, founder and CEO of a product-based business for women. “When I decided to launch my company full-time back in 2018, I quit drinking entirely to focus on growing my company and to give myself the best possible chances at success.”,Before that point, Hunter had spent 14 years working in investment banking, a job that included international travel—and opportunities to drink. “Boundaries are blurred easily when we're tipsy, and that's dangerous territory in a professional and social environment,” said Hunter.,Because she is no longer “distracted by the draw of liquid temptations,” Hunter finds that she can maintain her drive and determination to grow her business without the anxiety that alcohol can bring.,Hunter discovered that she didn’t need alcohol to engage with colleagues at industry events. She admitted, “It can initially feel rather uncomfortable or awkward to say no to an alcoholic drink among potential new friends. I like to remind myself that nobody's ever accused me of being boring and I've never regretted remaining sober for an event. It can only work in my favor.” She continued, “There’s nothing wrong with being perceived as more serious or committed. It can only add to the amount of respect a person has for you.”,By the time she was 35 years old, Annie Grace was a global marketing executive responsible for 28 countries and traveling internationally twice a month. She was also drinking almost two bottles of wine a night.,Determined to change her habit, Grace spent a year researching and changing her desire for alcohol, finally taking her last drink in 2015. When she shared a PDF of her research efforts online, over 20,000 people downloaded it in two weeks. As a result, Grace left the corporate world, wrote two books (“,” and “,”) and started , that helps people examine the role that alcohol plays in their lives.,“My goal is their goal,” said Grace of the people (mostly women) who seek her help. She knows that not everyone wants to cut alcohol out of their life completely, so she helps people to set a goal for what they want their relationship with alcohol to be. Once they feel positive about the direction they are heading in, they will have an easier time reaching that goal.,But Grace admits that it’s not a simple process.,She stopped drinking completely while still at her high-pressure corporate job and often encountered alcohol-related work situations. When she traveled to Brazil, local colleagues strong-armed her into tasting their national drink. When she was in the United Kingdom, a colleague purchased a $3,000 ticket for Grace to attend a wine tasting that featured bottles of wine worth $20,000 each. She said, “At that time, the pressure to drink was immense,” but she was secure enough in her decision that she was unphased.,Over 300,000 people have taken Grace’s free program. According to Grace, about half said that they no longer drink, and 36 percent drink less often.,Grace noticed that the people who decreased their alcohol intake said they were more energized and focused at work. Sometimes they took a deeper interest in their career, and other times, they found clarity to shift gears and move on to an industry or position better suited to their strengths. Grace pointed out that it’s much easier to stick with an unsatisfying job if you are “numbing” your discomfort with alcohol at the end of the day. Eliminating alcohol can help you figure out the type of work you really want to pursue.,Grace had three suggestions for women who want to reexamine their relationship with alcohol.,On a practical level, Bouman, Hunter and Tice all take a low-key approach to public sobriety. All three said that they like to have a (non-alcoholic) drink in hand at events. Bouman prefers kombucha, Hunter’s go-to is sparkling water and Tice enjoys mocktails like , or ,. Tice added that sipping on a mocktail is “probably the path of least resistance for people who are dipping a toe into early sobriety.”,Bouman initially relied on a phrase she heard from Whole30 co-founder and CEO ,. When offered a drink, Bouman would simply say, “I’m not drinking right now.”"
"On the "","" this week, , , that “we are out of the pandemic phase” with Covid (he later ,, saying that decelerating numbers indicate we are not in a “full-blown explosive” phase of the pandemic). But Fauci also ,, an indoor event this Saturday that expects 2,000 attendees, because of the risks of contracting the virus. “I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,"" he ,. President Joe Biden is 79. Both men fall in an age category at higher risk for developing severe illness if infected with Covid.,The risk for exposure to the virus at the event is not negligible. Physician and researcher Jeremy Faust estimated in a report for , that taking in the context — including the current case rate in Washington and negative testing the day of the event — the chance that at some point during the evening someone would be infectious is 50 percent. There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,There is an ongoing pandemic, and the president has a decent chance of being in the room with the causative virus.,The , in early April, which was linked to , (more than 10 percent of guests), was a cautionary tale. For that event, proof of vaccination was required, but it is unclear whether that requirement included boosters. There was no testing requirement, and few masks were worn. The event essentially embodied a “vaccination only” approach that abandoned other measures, and the results were grave indeed: Some attendees report they still ,, and the spread beyond the dinner to families, friends and co-workers can only be imagined. It was the kind of event that in ordinary times might trigger a CDC outbreak investigation.,Fortunately, the president himself is acting exactly as if a pandemic is in play, minimizing his own risk and taking the kind of layered precautions public health officials have been advising for these kinds of events; the same measures health officials appeared , for the Gridiron event. Per ,, Biden will likely wear a mask when not speaking and will not attend the eating portion of the dinner. “It’s a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis,” Psaki said.,If the Gridiron dinner were the exemplar for vaccines alone being adequate, then the White House Correspondents' Dinner seems to be modeling the personal risk calculator: Where Person A opts out, Person B opts in, but in a modified way to minimize exposure, and Person C gets to attend as if there were no pandemic at all. All made these decisions after considering their individual health status, the risks conferred to their close contacts, and the scenario at hand, where the crowd is vaccinated (if not boosted), some manner of negative test has been secured that day, and the quality of ventilation has or has not been assured.,But that scenario neglects Person D, who is staffing the event and can neither choose to stay home nor modify things like their time at the event or proximity to others. Cameron Shaw, a New York City beverage consultant and hospitality activist (and also my sister-in-law), points out that , have borne the brunt of the pandemic’s harms while rarely having health insurance or rapid access to testing, health care and newer therapeutics. “And now we are finding ourselves in environments serving (often very wealthy) people who had the luxury of working from home with bomb-proof health care plans for the majority of the pandemic,” she tells me. “Those who rely on the wages from these jobs to pay the rent don’t have a choice about whether we’re here for people to brazenly breathe on.” The personal risk calculator has a glitch. As Anne Sosin, policy fellow at Dartmouth’s Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, told me, “It obscures the unequal terms of participation.”,I wish some attendees saw an additional choice, to consider what kinds of things might allow Persons A, B, C , D to be safe at this event. Universal mask wearing, preferably of N95s, KN95s or KF94s, would provide an additional layer of national security, protecting our president from a real threat (at a time when our vice president has tested positive for Covid). It could allow Biden to more fully participate in the activities rather than asking him, the primary roastee in attendance, to perform acrobatics to accommodate the rest of the crowd. It would indicate concrete support for workers’ rights. It might even allow Fauci to attend the “,,” as he surely deserves.,As cases ebb and flow, we all have been making numerous decisions around risk for ourselves; even when mask mandates were common, there were a million undefined situations in which personal judgment came into place. Some people want the bothersome social elements to be utterly gone. But I suggest we stay willing to be inconvenienced. Nationally, ,. We remain part of a global pandemic. Respecting that means we respect all the lives present in the room, and those connected to them."
