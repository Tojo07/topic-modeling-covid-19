"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."

"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "

"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."
"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."

"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self.

""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"

"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."

"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"Since April 2020, there have been at least 16,800 people hospitalized for Covid in the U.S. over a seven-day period and as many as 159,000, a new peak set during the omicron surge. The country across the pandemic has averaged about 60,000 hospitalizations for Covid a day."

"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."

"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"

"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "

"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"

"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "

"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"
"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."

""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"

"Since April 2020, there have been at least 16,800 people hospitalized for Covid in the U.S. over a seven-day period and as many as 159,000, a new peak set during the omicron surge. The country across the pandemic has averaged about 60,000 hospitalizations for Covid a day."
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."

"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study. Those who got Covid, he pointed out, had some differences in their baseline cognitive function and in some of the initial brain scans compared with those who did not get the disease.,“It is possible, but perhaps unlikely,” he said, “that those who had higher risk for becoming infected were destined to progress more rapidly in the changes in their brain for other unmeasured reasons.”,That said, having the pairs of brain scans before and after an infection provided Douaud and her colleagues with a unique ability to factor out brain abnormalities that might have already been present before individuals developed Covid and therefore were not likely connected to the disease.,."

"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"

But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"
"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell.

"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "

"During at least the first few months following a coronavirus infection, even ,are associated with subtle tissue damage and accelerated losses in brain regions tied to the sense of smell, as well as a small loss in the brain’s overall volume, a new British study finds. Having mild Covid is also associated with a cognitive function deficit.,These are the striking findings of the new study led by University of Oxford investigators, one that leading Covid researchers consider particularly important because it is the first study of the disease’s potential , that is based on brain scans taken both before and after participants contracted the coronavirus. ,“This study design overcomes some of the major limitations of most brain-related studies of Covid-19 to date, which rely on analysis and interpretation at a single time point in people who had Covid-19,” said Dr. Serena S. Spudich, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.,The research, which was , Monday in Nature, also stands out because the lion’s share of its participants apparently had mild Covid — by far, the most common outcome of coronavirus infections. Most of the brain-related studies in this field have focused on those with moderate to severe Covid. ,, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Oxford and the paper’s lead author, said that the excess loss of brain volume she and her colleagues observed in brain scans of hundreds of British individuals is equivalent to at least one extra year of normal aging. ,“It is brain damage, but it is possible that it is reversible,” she said. “But it is still relatively scary because it was in mildly infected people.”,Douaud and her team relied on a rich data source: the ,. Before the Covid pandemic began, this mammoth database already had on hand tens of thousands of brain MRIs of people in Britain, along with responses to surveys about their diets and lifestyles and results from cognitive function tests. ,The investigators focused on 401 people between 51 and 81 years old who had tested positive for Covid according to clinical data linked to the Biobank study. They were invited back for a second brain scan, which they received an average of about five months after contracting the coronavirus. Covid was apparently mild in the vast majority of these participants; only 15 of them were hospitalized with the disease. ,The researchers compared these pairs of scans to those of a control group of 384 , participants who had not tested positive for Covid and were matched according to the Covid-positive group’s rates of obesity, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes, as well as their socioeconomic status, age and sex.,Between the pairs of MRIs, which were separated by an average of about three years, the researchers observed a striking trend among those who had Covid: a greater loss of what’s known as gray matter in the brain, as well as a higher rate of abnormalities in the brain tissue. Gray matter, which appears gray on certain brain scans, is comprised of various cells, including neurons.,It would be normal for adults within the study’s age range to lose a small amount of brain tissue after three years of aging, the researchers note. But compared with the control group, those who had Covid experienced an additional 0.2 percent to 2 percent loss of brain tissue in regions which are mostly associated with the sense of smell — specifically, in the ,, the orbitofrontal cortex and the insula.,The overall brain volume in people with Covid declined by an extra 0.3 percent over those without the disease.,Older participants experienced all these excess brain-related declines more profoundly.,The study offers no indication whether a Covid vaccination would mitigate the risk of such changes. The participants tested positive for the disease between March 2020 and April 2021, before the vaccines were widely available in the U.K. ,On cognitive function tests, those who had Covid demonstrated a slower ability to process information and had lower marks on what’s known as executive function, which is an umbrella measure of the brain’s ability to manage complex tasks. Again, these Covid-linked deficits were more pronounced among older individuals. ,Dr. ,, clinical director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, said that these findings “have long-term implications, since we would be concerned about the possibility of similar cognitive dysfunction in a large population worldwide."" ,""It needs to be determined if these patients could further deteriorate over a period of time,"" he said.,The investigators had no access to data on any Covid-related symptoms the participants may have experienced. So they don’t know if the participants actually lost their sense of smell or have experienced long-term symptoms in the disease’s wake. Some likely had asymptomatic cases.,That said, the , was particularly prevalent among those infected with the coronavirus during the first two major waves of the pandemic. And when particular regions of the brain go unused, they are inclined to atrophy. Nevertheless, the study’s authors don’t know whether the coronavirus caused a loss of smell through a nonbrain-based mechanism and this, in turn, prompted the brain damage, or if possibly the brain damage caused the loss of smell.,A study , in Cell in February found that a coronavirus infection of various cells in the nasal cavity gives rise to inflammation that inhibits the functioning of smell-receptor proteins on nerve cells, leading to smell loss. ,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself. This is true even in older people.,Covid’s link to declines in the smell-related brain regions, Douaud said, does not discount the other ways that it might impact the brain in regions unrelated to smell. The disease has proved maddeningly variable from patient to patient, and other studies have identified various means by which severe Covid in particular might damage the brain. What the study revealed is that changes to the smell-related regions were the most consistent brain-related trend tied to Covid in the study cohort. ,Whether these changes will persist over the long term remains unknown. Douaud is hoping to conduct a third round of brain scans.,“The brain is plastic, which means it can reorganize and heal itself,” she said. “This is true even in older people.” ,Experts in long Covid praised Douaud’s paper.,“This study provides the most definitive clinical data available to date that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly damages nerves and that this, in turn, can have systemic effects, including changes in the brain,” said Dr. ,, a veteran HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. “It contributes to an emerging theme that nerve damage was common during the first few waves of the pandemic.”,Deeks, who is directing a major cohort study of people suffering from persistent symptoms following a coronavirus infection, noted a limitation of the new study.

"They bought Lamborghinis, , and ,.,And Teslas, of course. Lots of ,.,Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest , in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.,They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News , last year. And another , potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.,The prevalence of Covid relief fraud has been known for some time, but the enormous scope and its disturbing implications are only now becoming clear.,Even if the highest estimates are inflated, the total fraud in all Covid relief funds amounts to a mind-boggling sum of taxpayer money that could rival the , in federal funds included in President Joe Biden’s massive 10-year infrastructure spending plan, according to prosecutors, government watchdogs and private experts who are trying to plug the leaks.,“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Matthew Schneider, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan who is now with Honigman LLP. “It is the biggest fraud in a generation.”,Most of the losses are considered unrecoverable, but there is still a chance to stanch the bleeding, because federal officials say $600 billion is still waiting to go out the door. The Biden administration imposed new verification rules last year that administration officials say appear to have made a difference in curbing fraud. But they acknowledge that programs in 2020 sacrificed security for speed, needlessly.,Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who oversees Covid relief spending, told ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt in an exclusive interview that Covid relief programs were structured in ways that made them ripe for plunder.,“The Small Business Administration, in sending that money out, basically said to people, ‘Apply and sign and tell us that you're really entitled to the money,’” said Horowitz, the chair of the ,. “And, of course, for fraudsters, that's an invitation. … What didn't happen was even minimal checks to make sure that the money was getting to the right people at the right time.”,The criminal methodology varied depending on the program. The , of Covid unemployment relief has been carried out by individual criminals or organized crime groups using stolen identities to claim jobless benefits from state workforce agencies disbursing federal funds. Each identity could be worth up to $30,000 in benefits, Horowitz said.,The looting of the Paycheck Protection Program worked differently — and it could be far more lucrative. The program authorized banks and other financial institutions to make government-backed loans to businesses, loans that were to be forgiven if the companies spent the money on business expenses. Nearly 10 million such loans have already been forgiven. Many of the loans-turned-grants were for millions of dollars, public records show.,Experts say millions of borrowers inflated their numbers of employees or created companies out of whole cloth. For much of 2020, lenders did little to verify the applications, prosecutors and experts say, in part because Congress required the Small Business Administration, or SBA, which ran the program, to issue explicit , that in the interest of getting the money out fast, lenders “will be held harmless for borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.” The Government Accountability Office , of fraud risk, but the program continued under that rule.,“The government spent approximately $800 billion and provided 21 million loans to individuals,” said Haywood Talcove, the CEO for government at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which works with the government to verify identities.,No one is sure exactly how much was stolen. An ,released last year estimated at least $76 billion in potential fraud, and the authors said that was conservative.,The SBA’s inspector general has identified , in potentially fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans, another Covid relief program for businesses. The Secret Service has its own estimate: ,.,The basic scheme, Talcove said, was “really simple.” People went on state websites and took the names of existing businesses or registered new, fake ones.,“There's absolutely no security on there. There's no validation of any information,” Talcove said. “And voila, you have company ABC with 40 employees and a payroll of $10 million. And you go and apply for a PPP loan. It was a piece of cake.”,To find more cases, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee is employing data scientists who use artificial intelligence to plow through 150 million records searching for fraud patterns. In one case it found that a phone number for a gas station in Houston was used on 150 loan applications. It sends such leads to federal agents who follow up on foot.,One of the centers of the fraud is Miami, where Juan Gonzalez is the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Florida.,Gonzalez said that unlike with unemployment relief, which went to every person who qualified, lenders had to stop making PPP loans when the money ran out, even though demand continued. The fraud didn’t harm just the taxpayers — it hurt people who needed the money.,The public, he said, “should be very angry.”,“This is billions of taxpayer dollars that has been stripped from them,” he said. “And more angry should be the people who did lose their jobs, who worked for businesses that couldn't apply for this money because it was gone. Those are really the ones who should be the angriest of all.”,Gonzalez said he has seen a lot of fraud in Florida, including billions pilfered every year from the federal Medicare program. But never has so much been stolen so quickly, he said.,“I have a hard time imagining when so much money has gone so quickly into the hands of people who don't deserve it,” he added.,David Hines, 29, of Miami, for example, admitted to a fraud scheme that netted him $3.9 million, according to his guilty plea. Hines, who said in court papers that he struggled with addiction, bought a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracán. He also spent thousands on luxury hotels, jewelry, clothing and dating sites, say prosecutors, who seized the car and recovered much of the money.,Also in Miami, a man and a woman admitted to a complex scheme in which, among other things, they , — with many employees — out of small, single-family homes in the middle of the city.,“Once you looked at the paperwork and once you saw what it was, all it took was a drive to the farm to see there was no farm,” Gonzalez said.,In another Florida case, prosecutors have charged a man who they say used proceeds from a $7.2 million emergency loan to buy a 12,579-square-foot mansion, a Lincoln Navigator car, a Maserati and a Mercedes-Benz.,A , were convicted in June of stealing $18 million, with which they bought three houses, diamonds, gold coins, luxury watches, expensive furniture and other valuables, prosecutors said. Just as they were to be sentenced, they ,, leaving their children behind, according to the FBI.,They were captured in February in Montenegro. The man was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and his wife got six years.,Their case underscores that most of the defendants have been freed while they have awaited trial and sentencing, even though they have been accused of stealing huge sums.,Washington, D.C., resident Elias Eldabbagh, who appears to have no criminal record, was charged last summer with trying to steal $17 million from PPP and another program. According to his LinkedIn page, he earned a degree in computer engineering from California State University, Sacramento, and has worked in various technology jobs. Among the property prosecutors seized was a Tesla Model 3.,He had been released on his own recognizance as he awaited trial, but he was recently jailed after prosecutors accused him of a new crime — attempting to defraud a bank — while his original case was pending. Court records show he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment.,In the annals of Covid fraud cases, few have matched the brazenness suspected of Danielle Miller, according to federal prosecutors in Boston, where she was charged. The charging documents in her case say she stole identifying information from a Massachusetts state website and used the information to apply for Covid relief loans.,In 40 minutes, she had $100,000 in taxpayer money, court documents say. She soon booked a private jet from Florida to California, where she spent $5,500 at a luxury hotel in West Hollywood, court papers allege.,On her Instagram account, which has 34,000 followers, Miller posted photos from two posh hotel stays paid for with criminal proceeds, prosecutors say. Her bio: “I want that.”,“Miller’s criminal record includes arrests in five different states, many of which were related to larceny and identity-related fraud,” the complaint in the case says.,Miller pleaded not guilty, but court records now say she intends to plead guilty to an unspecified charge.,She participated , that portrayed her as a child of wealthy Manhattan parents whose life was derailed by the circulation of a sexually explicit video when she was in the eighth grade.,“Honestly, I more so consider myself a con artist than anything,” the magazine quoted her as saying. “You know how they have that saying that you can sell ice to an Eskimo? If there’s something that I want, I’m getting it.”,Hines got six years in prison, and the , 18 and 30 months. But Gonzalez and other government officials acknowledge that for every person caught, many, many more have gotten away with it. And while prosecutors have 10 years to go after the fraud, given the enormous scope of the criminality, the Justice Department simply doesn’t have the resources to go after it all.,“I think there's going to be a percentage that we probably will never catch,” he said. “But we're working as hard as we can to catch as many as we can.”,Across the country, only 178 people have been convicted so far in PPP fraud cases, according to the Justice Department. Many more prosecutions are coming, but even if the numbers reach 2,000 — or 20,000 — it will be only a small fraction of the fraud.,So how was this allowed to happen? There are two prevailing theories, one more forgiving of the government than the other.,Many government officials, including Gonzalez, say that because the government was trying to respond quickly during the pandemic, a conscious decision was made to make the application process as smooth as possible, even at the expense of thorough vetting.,“You have government releasing a lot of money as quickly as possible into the hands of people who really need it,” he said. “As usually happens, the faster the money needs to go out, the less likely there are to be the appropriate checks in place to make sure that people who don't deserve that money don't get it.”,“What surprised me the most is just how blatant it was,” Gonzalez said. “How individuals would just go ahead and lie on these applications — get the money and then go ahead just openly spend it … thinking that they're going to do that without anybody checking up on it.”,He added: “Some fraud is inevitable. That’s the price that the government was willing to pay to get the money as quickly as possible into the hands of those that really needed it.”,As for the lenders, he said, “perhaps because it was not their money that was on the line, some of these institutions didn't do the type of diligence they should've done.”,The case of the California couple pursued by the SBA inspector general appears to illustrate that fraudsters were leveraging the apparent incuriosity of those doling out the cash.,The defendants, Richard Ayvazyan and Marietta Terabelian, got millions of dollars by using stolen identifies to get around Ayvazyan’s disqualifying 2011 conviction for bank fraud, court records say. They texted about the cash that was available: ""You need to apply. 10k guaranteed...they don't check for s---...it's all automated."",Days later, they were texting that they had gotten the money. ""I did 7 [applications] last night and 4 of them got email that it’s funded...I'm telling you to apply [to] Bluevine,"" an online lender.,""how much they send u"",""Like over 500 so far."",Congressional officials say they are investigating a half-dozen lenders and service providers, including Bluevine, which processed loan applications for $4.5 billion and touted that a business could get loan approval in five minutes.,Bluevine said in a statement that it used “robust compliance” to reduce fraud in accordance with government guidelines and that it was “regrettable” that the government’s loan programs were “abused by bad actors … despite our best efforts.”,Talcove, whose company maintains huge databases of public records and sells verification services to governments, says the government and the lenders and banks could and should have prevented such widespread fraud.,When Covid relief was proposed, he said, he spoke to Larry Kudlow, then a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump.,“And I explained to him that this was going to be the biggest fraud in the history of our country. And then I was told that you can have speed or you can have security. And that they'd rather just get the money out.”,Talcove said he told Kudlow that banks have the ability to rapidly identify their customers.,Kudlow didn’t respond to requests for comment.,The idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and security “is a false premise,” Talcove said. “It's not true. If you believed that, then some of our biggest companies in this country that face consumers would be bankrupt, right? It is very easy to stop the type of fraud that we're looking at. In fact, the private sector stopped this a decade ago.,“The problem that happened is the states panicked, as well as the Small Business Administration.”,In a statement, the SBA said it “takes fraud seriously, and, as such, all applicants are required to provide certification of their eligibility upon application.”,“Misrepresentation of eligibility is unlawful, and, when appropriate, these cases are referred to the Office of the Inspector General,” it said.,But an official who works on Covid relief and wasn’t authorized to speak publicly acknowledged that Talcove is correct. In the early stages of the loan program, he said, there were few controls. And it didn’t have to be that way.,“I agree,” he said, “that the notion that you had to sacrifice certainty for speed is categorically false.”"
"The Food and Drug Administration authorized the first injectable , for long-term prevention of Covid-19 among people with weakened immune systems before they have been exposed to the coronavirus. ,The FDA issued an , Wednesday for AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail, Evusheld, for what is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, against Covid-19. ,To date, such laboratory-produced antibodies have been authorized only as early treatment of Covid-19 or as preventive therapy for high-risk people immediately after close contact with someone who has tested positive.,Evusheld can be used as PrEP by people ages 12 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and may not get adequate ,. The therapy is also an option for the rare people who have histories of severe adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine or its components.,The AstraZeneca therapy involves getting preventive injections as often as every six months. According to a large placebo-controlled clinical trial, the cocktail is about 83 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease during such an interval.,It’s unclear how the , of the coronavirus — which is spreading in 57 countries, including the U.S.—  might affect the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody therapy. ,AstraZeneca's scientists are testing Evusheld against the new variant, said Ruud Dobber, an executive vice president and president of the company’s BioPharmaceuticals Business Unit. They are optimistic about its efficacy against the omicron variant because both of the antibodies in the cocktail, tixagevimab and cilgavimab, target the virus’s spike protein in different and complementary ways. ,Data are expected in the coming weeks, Dobber said in a statement. ,Still, for many of the estimated 3 percent of U.S. adults who are immunocompromised, the long-awaited news that antibody PrEP has finally been cleared should bring profound relief. ,“This new FDA authorization is a very important development for those with immunosuppression,” said Dr. Alfred Kim, a rheumatologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ,Evusheld as PrEP, he said, “provides a healthy load of antibodies for the 40 percent to 80 percent of the immunosuppressed who have very poor antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.”,Immunosuppression is associated with a much higher risk of breakthrough coronavirus infections and severe Covid. Even after vaccination, many people — including transplant recipients and those treated for cancer or autoimmune conditions — have had to remain under lonesome lockdowns to protect themselves against Covid.,Janet Handal, 70, a transplant recipient from New York City, manages a , for fellow immunocompromised people that has nearly 900 members. Handal, hoping Evusheld will prove potent against the omicron variant, said PrEP will be transformative for her group’s members. ,“We can rejoin life. We can rejoin our families. We can hug someone without fear,” she said. ,Lucy Horton, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Diego, said that Evusheld as PrEP can provide an additional layer of protection for the vaccinated and vulnerable but that it “should not be viewed as an alternative to or replacement of vaccine.” ,PrEP candidates must test negative for the coronavirus. They also must not have had known recent exposures to infected people. ,In the major ,, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, nearly 5,200 initially unvaccinated participants in the U.S. and Western Europe were randomized 2-to-1 to receive a single injection of Evusheld or a placebo. After a median six months of follow-up, the antibody injection had reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by 83 percent compared to the placebo, AstraZeneca said.,There have been no cases of severe Covid-19 or death related to the disease among those who got the antibody injection, compared to five severe cases and two such deaths in the placebo group. ,The study participants are scheduled for 15 months of follow-up.,Seventy-five percent of the participants had health conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid, such as diabetes or obesity. Although only 3 percent were immunocompromised, experts have still expressed confidence that Evusheld as PrEP should be safe and no less effective among such people.,The federal government has an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 700,000 doses of Evusheld, which will be available at no cost to eligible patients. The first doses should be available “very soon,” with all doses delivered in a few months, Dobber said.,While the drug is free to patients, health care facilities may charge to administer it, so people could still incur some out-of-pocket costs."
"A full two years into the coronavirus pandemic,, remain sick and in desperate search of answers. They've lost jobs. They've lost their sense of self. Many say they have lost faith in the medical community.,Despite multiple studies, the launch of dozens of specialized long Covid clinics and , for the National Institutes of Health to study the condition, there remains a dearth of proven treatments for people who are suffering from lingering illness after their infection. ,""There is no one right answer for many of our patients,"" said Dr. Ben Abramoff, director of the Post-COVID Assessment and Recovery Clinic at Penn Medicine, which has seen more than 1,100 long Covid patients.,Compounding the problem is a lack of consensus on how to define long Covid, according to a commentary published Tuesday in the , from researchers at UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles.,""We do not know what constitutes long Covid or how to formally diagnose it,"" the authors wrote. ""An improved understanding of this condition is needed to provide appropriate care for our patients."",Most ,, including Penn Medicine, treat patients with a variety of medical teams, including counselors, ,, pulmonologists, physical therapists and immunologists.,But it can take months to get an appointment, and many patients say finding treatment for long Covid can be time-consuming and draining. That gap has allowed private companies to step in with promises of relief. ,The most well-known is IncellDx, a California-based company that said it has accomplished three key goals specific to long Covid: a diagnostic test, a treatment plan, including an HIV drug and cholesterol-lowering medications, and a way to show patients that the treatment is working.,Critics counter that there are no simple , to determine whether someone has long Covid. Even at highly respected clinics, treatment regimens vary widely and doctors don't offer cures. Instead, most treat the symptoms in an effort to get patients back to some sense of normalcy. ,The , that come with long Covid make it difficult to come up with a standardized treatment.,The illness, characterized by lingering symptoms weeks to months after an infection, can take on many forms. Some people have daily migraines. Others lose their train of thought midsentence. Some can no longer walk the short distance from their front door to their mailbox.,In the past two years, scores of long Covid treatment clinics, typically affiliated with hospitals or medical research centers, have opened nationwide. ,When Laurie Bedell, 42, of Pittsburgh, first sought treatment, she waited nearly eight months for an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic more than 130 miles away. When her health insurance refused to pay for the visit, she was forced to find a doctor closer to home. ,""I waited months and got nothing done,"" she said. ""I'll probably be waiting months again for hopefully somebody in Pittsburgh."",The wait is not easy for patients like Bedell — a former nursing director who, before Covid, was accustomed to working out for two hours, six days a week. Now, she said, ""I physically can't function. I have a walker. I can't drive because I have cognitive dysfunction, and my vision's constantly blurry."",At the Covid Activity Rehabilitation Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where doctors have treated hundreds of people with long Covid, patients are advised to take their recovery slowly.,""Patients, when they get sick, they just so want to get back to normal life,"" said Dr. Greg Vanichkachorn, an occupational medicine specialist who heads Mayo's post-Covid program. ,But plunging into normal activities is exhausting after so much time being sick, and can lead to flare-ups and fatigue that feel like a relapse. ,""The body just can't handle that,"" he said. ""Pacing is so important — helping people understand the importance of proper pacing from the very get-go so they don't get into this situation."",Vanichkachorn, like many long Covid clinicians, focuses on treating symptoms. He often prescribes a blood pressure medicine called midodrine and a steroid called florinef in an attempt to improve blood flow in the body. Physical therapy is also important, he said, to help keep muscles toned and as strong as possible.,Hinda Stockstill, 35, of Cincinnati, said her long Covid has improved following a combination of treatments from both her family doctor and physicians at the Cleveland Clinic's post-Covid treatment center.,She has undergone physical and occupational therapy, and has taken an antiviral called acyclovir and fluvoxamine, which treats depression.,""It didn't cure me completely,"" Stockstill said. ""I still do have some days where I'm just so tired, I can barely get up. But they're fewer and far between."",""Most patients have improvement over time,"" Abramoff said. But about half ""don't get back to 100 percent."",The cause of long Covid is still unknown. Why do some people infected with the coronavirus recover, while others continue to be plagued by symptoms?  ,Several theories exist. A recent ,suggested that the immune systems in some people do not react appropriately to the virus, and don’t trigger the correct antibodies. Another , found that the coronavirus may reactivate the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, or be linked to Type 2 diabetes. ,In February 2021, the NIH energized legions of long-haulers with the allocation of more than $1 billion for , through 2025.,We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!,""We all were really hopeful — like, OK, finally something is happening!"" Bedell said. She was part of a focus group of long Covid patients from which the NIH sought guidance as it began its flagship research project called Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or ,. ,The research aims to enroll 20,000 people. As of Friday, 1,175 had been enrolled, a prime example of how painstakingly slow the scientific process can be — even during a pandemic. ,""I understand people are desperate,"" said Dr. Stuart Katz, a principal investigator of the RECOVER trial, as well as the director of New York University Langone's heart failure program.,The goal of the trial is not to treat patients, at least not at first. ,""We're trying to define, 'What is long Covid? What are the best diagnostic tools?'"" he said.,If potential treatments are recommended, it'll be after researchers have scoured ""the entire scientific literature,"" Katz said. ,""It's a huge undertaking, but if we're going to ask sick people to be in a study and devote resources to that study, we want to try to offer the best, most promising treatment,"" he said. ,For some patients, the long waits, the lack of clear answers and the slow steps toward recovery are too much to bear.,That's why thousands have turned to IncellDx, a diagnostic company based in San Carlos, California.,After months of dizziness, shortness of breath and nerve pain, Sara Anaya, 43, of Santa Maria, California, went to the Covid Recovery Clinic at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she said she was offered physical therapy, mental health counseling and neurological testing.,She tried the physical therapy, but said it left her even more fatigued to the point where she could not get out of bed for days. She was frustrated, she said, that the USC clinic would not offer medications, even though none has been approved to treat long Covid. ,""A lot of people think what they want is a pill,"" Abramoff, of Penn Medicine, said. But ""we don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it."",A lot of people think what they want is a pill. We don’t have that pill, and we're not particularly close to having it.,Anaya turned to IncellDx, where she was able to get a telemedicine appointment with the company's founder, Dr. Bruce Patterson, ""almost immediately."" All patients are seen virtually. ,Patterson is a virologist who was heavily involved in HIV research for decades before shifting his focus to long Covid in 2020. ,The main premise of IncellDx is a diagnostic blood test which the company claims can diagnose long Covid, help determine effective therapies and show any improvements after treatment. IncellDx does not do blood draws; instead, patients must send a blood sample to the company for analysis.,The test looks at levels of 14 immune system proteins called cytokines that the company says indicate the blood vessel inflammation specific to long Covid. ,Those 14 markers were identified using mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence, Patterson said. They're able to show, he said, ""what's different about these long Covid patients?"",IncellDx clinicians don't prescribe drugs directly to patients, but do provide patients with a ""treatment recommendation"" that they can take to their personal physicians. It typically includes an HIV drug called maraviroc, and statins, which are usually used to lower cholesterol. Neither are approved to treat long Covid.,Long Covid physicians affiliated with hospitals and major medical centers dispute whether the diagnostic test is valid. While some clinics do blood tests and imaging to learn more about what's going on in a patient's body, nearly all rely on symptoms to make a diagnosis.  ,""You don't need a blood test to diagnose long-haulers,"" said Dr. Kanao Otsu, lead immunologist at the Center for Post-Covid Care and Recovery at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""You don't need a cytokine panel to tell you that you're still suffering from your Covid that you had nine months ago."",More than 18,000 people have taken IncellDx's test, Patterson said. Nearly all — 95 percent — have been diagnosed with long Covid based on it. ,That's a red flag, said Dr. Marc Sala, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist who sees long Covid patients at Northwestern Medicine's Comprehensive Covid-19 Center. A test can only be validated, he said, through using it on a diverse group of people — in other words, a large mix of people both with and without long Covid. ,What's more, there is no evidence to prove that raising or lowering any of IncellDx's long Covid markers can actually treat the condition, he said.,""None of this is based on human trial data,"" he said. ,Patterson said the company plans to carry out randomized clinical trials, but defended moving forward without them in the meantime.,""We're in a pandemic,"" he said. ""I don't know that these patients can wait 18 months for the results of a trial."",Anaya said the medications recommended by IncellDx and prescribed to her by a local doctor worked, though it took a couple of months. She still has very little sense of smell. ,Not all patients have had similar success.,Anne McCloskey, 53, of Seattle, was part of the IncellDx's original research and was not charged any fee when she sought help in November 2020.,IncellDx's tests showed that she had elevated levels of biomarkers that indicated long Covid. She started with the company's regimen, along with several other treatments.,Several months later, a repeat IncellDx blood test suggested she'd largely recovered. But McCloskey still suffered from fevers, extreme fatigue and memory lapses. ,[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick.,""[Patterson] told me that I was his poster child for recovery. And I'm like, you know, I'm still really sick."",The extreme vulnerability of long Covid patients makes it all the more important for doctors — in clinics and companies — to avoid making promises that a test or treatment is the definitive answer without rigorous scientific study and data to back them up, said Dr. Myles Sheehan, director of the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics at the Georgetown University Medical Center.,The danger, he said, ""is that the hope that they offer will be proven false, which could be very devastating to people who are reaching out like a drowning man asking for somebody to save him."",It is that lack of scientific data that makes already vulnerable long Covid patients even more susceptible to unproven claims, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.,""I worry that our collective inability to put together trials to come up with therapeutics for these patients with long Covid creates the opportunity for other groups and companies to exploit patients,"" he said.,""We are dropping the ball on long Covid patients."",. "
