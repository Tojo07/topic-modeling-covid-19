Italy is reporting 699 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and is recording more than 100 deaths per day, with a total confirmed death toll at 163,500. But hospital capacity remains stable and under the critical threshold.,

"J.C. Sampedro has an emotional reunion with friends and family after his release from the hospital,women who become infected with the delta variant face a significantly higher risk of a stillbirth or dying during childbirth, new studies show.,The Centers for , released a report Friday that examined 1.2 million deliveries in 736 hospitals nationwide from March 2020 through September 2021.,Stillbirths were rare overall, totaling 8,154 among all deliveries. But researchers found that for women with COVID-19, about one in 80 deliveries resulted in a stillbirth. Among the uninfected, the rate was one in 155.,
      Dr. Jessica Zucker is ready to change the way people discuss pregnancy loss.
      ,Among those with COVID-19, stillbirths were more common in people with chronic high blood pressure and other complications, including those in intensive care or on breathing machines, according to the studies.,""These findings underscore the importance of COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination before or during pregnancy,"" said CDC researcher Carla DeSisto and co-authors.,There’s no information on how many women had received COVID-19 shots, although the authors noted that the U.S. vaccination rate among pregnant women after the highly contagious delta variant emerged this past summer was just 30%.,Pregnant women infected with COVID-19 were more likely than others to develop severe, even fatal, illness and they also faced increased risks for preterm birth and other complications, the researchers found. Previous studies on stillbirths and COVID-19 had mixed findings, but the new report bolsters concerns among obstetricians and anecdotal data.,
      The shift comes after the global health agency faced criticism for its stance as it conflicted with guidance from the CDC. Experts also voiced concerns that inconsistent information could confuse expectant women hoping to learn if they should be vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. 
      ,While the risk for a stillbirth is low, anyone who is pregnant shouldn’t underestimate the dangers of COVID-19, said Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. He helped write the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.,""What’s really sad is we have 10 months of a vaccine that’s been highly effective, and we just can’t convince people to take advantage of this,"" Turrentine said of a minority of vaccine resisters.,Some experts have speculated that the virus may cause inflammation in the placenta or other abnormalities that could harm the fetus.,Dr. Joseph Biggio, a specialist in high-risk pregnancies at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, said the study doesn’t prove that COVID-19 causes stillbirths. He said it’s possible some women were so critically ill that physicians trying to keep them alive ""couldn’t intervene on behalf of a fetus that they knew was in trouble."",The researchers relied on medical records and noted that they were unable to determine if the COVID-19 diagnoses listed at the time of delivery represented current or past infections.,Generally, stillbirths are more common among Black people, those who become pregnant over age 35 or those who smoke tobacco during pregnancy.,The study didn’t include pregnancy outcomes by race, an area the authors said they plan to investigate in future research ""because COVID-19 has disproportionately affected many racial and ethnic minority groups, putting them more at risk of getting sick and dying."""

""We ensured that we would invest in and buy a broad variety – across monoclonal antibodies, pre-exposure prevention treatments, and antiviral pills."" ,The official told Fox News that in the month of January, the administration will have more therapeutics that work against circulating variants, both delta and omicron, ""than ever before in the pandemic,"" saying there will be close to 4 million treatment doses available. ,Biden is scheduled to meet with his COVID-19 response team Tuesday afternoon to receive an update on the omicron variant, and to discuss his administration's response. ,Health officials are set to brief the president on the latest resources and personnel being sent to states and local communities to help with staffing needs and hospital capacity, as well as the ongoing work to expand access to COVID-19 treatments. ,As for the omicron variant, health officials are expected to say that while cases continue to increase, fully vaccinated and boosted Americans that get infected are not likely to have severe symptoms. ,Following his briefing, the president is expected to announce the updates, including the government's purchase of the 10 million additional doses of the Pfizer pill, in brief remarks Tuesday afternoon. , , ,Biden is set to highlight Pfizer's Paxlovid, and will cite studies that show the treatment can ""greatly reduce the chances of hospitalization and death for those at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID."" ,Paxlovid is a protease inhibitor designed to block an enzyme the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs to replicate in human cells. Protease inhibitors are a class of drugs that prevent viruses from replicating within cells in the human body, which renders them unable to multiply and spread within the body, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. ,The pill can treat mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease in adults and children 12 years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms or about 88 pounds. An individual can only use the drug is they meet those qualifications, have tested positive for COVID-19, and who ""are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death,"" the FDA said last month.,Paxlovid is available by prescription only and should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of COVID-19 and within five days of symptom onset. ,Paxlovid is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in those requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. Paxlovid is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose are recommended, the FDA said.,The FDA still ""urges the public to get vaccinated and receive a booster if eligible."",Paxlovid consists of nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protein to stop the virus from replicating, and ritonavir, which slows down nirmatrelvir’s breakdown to help it remain in the body for a longer period at higher concentrations, the FDA said. ,Treatment involves taking three tablets – two tablets of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir – together orally twice daily for five days, for a total of 30 tablets. Paxlovid is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. "

The recommendation is not final and will go before the FDA to issue an official decision.,The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) was charged with weighing whether safety and effectiveness data supported an emergency authorization for a booster shot at two months following the initial dose, stemming from a trial involving 30,000 participants.,The panel’s vote Friday applied to all individuals ages 18 and older, while the panel previously endorsed authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna booster shots across certain high-risk groups, like adults over age 65 and people ages 18-64 at high risk of exposure and severe COVID-19 disease.,Company findings presented during the meeting Friday indicated the initial dose was 74% effective against severe disease and 70% protective against symptomatic disease, however a booster shot administered at two months increased protection to 94%, according to Dr. Penny Heaton, global therapeutic area head at Janssen. However, studies indicated ranging efficacies, and surveillance data found the initial shot was 68% effective against hospitalization among adults without immunocompromising conditions.,Protection from the initial dose was durable over time, Heaton said, which contrasts to the fading protection seen with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. However, the J&J vaccine offers less protection compared to the mRNA shots, even with their waning, Cohn noted.,""The reality is that your vaccine does seem to be holding up actually quite well in terms of durability, so the immediate need for a booster is not apparent,"" panel member Dr. Michael Kurilla told J&J officials, but he noted some potential benefit against emerging variants.,Of note, panel members noted concern that the FDA hadn’t yet conducted full independent analyses or verification of the company-submitted data including thousands of patients, which would have taken months to review, according to Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.,Uptake of the one-shot J&J vaccine has lagged far behind vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, at 15.2 million doses administered, versus 236 million and 153 million shots in arms, respectively, per CDC data. In April, federal health officials lifted an 11-day pause on use of the J&J , ,  following a review and the recommendation of a panel of experts who determined it , despite rare instances of severe blood clots.,In an updated safety analysis Friday, J&J officials noted not a single case of the rare clotting syndrome, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), was detected in the booster shot trials.,Finally, Dr. Paul Offit, voting member and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that most people who received the initial J&J one-shot vaccine received it more than two months ago, and the panel on Friday declined to recommend the booster when administered after six months due to insufficient data and a small sample size of 17 participants. What’s more, panel members suggested the J&J vaccine is better fit as a two-dose series with an amended emergency use authorization, instead of a single dose and a follow-up booster shot."
"If you're wondering about when to get that next COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, or even if you need it, you're not alone. Now a new test is on the way that could offer answers to those questions.,A possible contributor of Long COVID -19 may actually be an abnormally suppressed immune system, and not a hyperactive one, according to a UCLA- led research group. The study, recently published in the peer-reviewed , ,It contradicts what scientists previously believed, which was that an overactive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, often referred to as a ""cytokine storm,"" was the root cause of the perplexing syndrome. Health experts told Fox News this ""cytokine storm"" is an over-reactive inflammatory response in the infected person that can potentially cause damage to lungs and other organs, possibly creating severe illness or even death. ,Long COVID, which occurs in a subset of patients recovering from COVID-19, is a syndrome where a multitude of symptoms including shortness of breath, muscle aches, fatigue, vocal fatigue, and brain fog persists for several months after the acute infection stage, health experts explained to Fox News. ,

      ,While investigating the notion that long COVID-19 is , by an underlying hyperactive immune response, the UCLA-led team of researchers studied the effect of the monoclonal antibody Leronlimab on Long COVID-19, in a small exploratory trial that involved 55 people with the condition. Leronlimab is an antibody that attaches to an immune receptor involved in inflammation called CCR5, the study authors explained in the release.,Participants were randomly selected to receive weekly injections of the antibody or a saline placebo for eight weeks. During that period, the investigators tracked changes in 24 symptoms associated with long COVID, according to the release.,In the report, the investigators explained that they , thought blocking CCR5 with Leronlimab would weaken the overactive immune system’s response after a COVID-19 infection.,""But we found just the opposite,"" Yang, who is also the senior author, said in the release. ""Patients who improved were those who started with low CCR5 on their T cells, suggesting their immune system was less active than normal, and levels of CCR5 actually increased in people who improved. This leads to the new hypothesis that long COVID in some persons is related to the immune system being suppressed and not hyperactive, and that while blocking its activity, the antibody can stabilize CCR5 expression on the cell surface leading to upregulation of other immune receptors or functions."",The researchers stated in the release that the findings , ""a complex role for CCR5 in balancing inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, e.g. through T regulatory cells.""  ,

The most common symptoms reported by the group of long COVID patients were shortness of breath (37%) and chronic fatigue (36%).  These were followed by sleep problems (16%), brain fog (13%) and visual problems (13%), according to the release. ,The researchers' analysis suggested that individuals with severe cases, who required immunosuppressant drugs such as tocilizumab, were six times as likely to report long COVID symptoms and those who were treated with high flow oxygen support were 40 percent more likely to experience long hauler symptoms. ,The release also noted that women compared to men, were almost twice as likely to report long COVID symptoms. The authors noted that patients with type 2 diabetes seemed to have a lower risk of developing long COVID symptoms and said further studies are needed to better understand this finding. ,

"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.,A large new study found that people who recovered from , within the past year are 40% more likely to receive a new diagnosis of diabetes compared to those who weren't infected.,The increased risk translates into 1% of people who have had Covid-19 developing , who otherwise wouldn't have, the study's author says, resulting in potentially millions of new cases world-wide.,Most of the people with diabetes in the ,, were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, not Type 1. Some researchers say Covid-19 could also be triggering an entirely new type of diabetes in which certain cells mistakenly start to raise, rather than lower, blood sugar.,The study adds to evidence showing an increased post-Covid-19 risk of cardiometabolic conditions, such as diabetes as well as , and kidney complications. Normally when people think of long-term Covid-19 symptoms, they think of problems such as cognitive issues, fatigue or shortness of breath. But scientists say there are likely different types of long Covid, and one appears to be defined by cardiometabolic problems that arise after Covid-19. So far, the , there have been more than 464 million cases of Covid-19, so even small percentages of those people developing long-term complications would be significant.,""We're finding out more and more that it's not only respiratory problems or brain fog or only fatigue,"" says Ziyad Al-Aly , chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study. ""There are heart manifestations, and clearly diabetes and kidney manifestations."",Dr. Al-Aly's group has recently published studies on those broader risks. One showed a higher risk of developing heart problems, including , and heart attack, in people who have had Covid-19 than in people who haven't. Another showed post-Covid-19 patients were more likely to have declines in kidney function or kidney damage as much as six months after infection when compared to patients who hadn't had Covid-19.,The researchers found only an association between Covid-19 and cardiometabolic conditions, without proving a cause. Some doctors say that new diagnoses of Type 2 diabetes and heart conditions could be influenced by weight gain or decreased activity during the pandemic, although lifestyle changes wouldn't necessarily explain an increase specifically in people who have had Covid-19.,In the new diabetes study, Dr. Al-Aly and co-researchers analyzed the records of 181,000 Covid-19 patients in the Veterans Health Administration system who were diagnosed with Covid-19 within the past year and compared them to more than eight million people who didn't have Covid-19. The VA study didn't look at diabetes cases by vaccination status.,""When you look at the data on a national scale it's clearly happening even in people who have no risk factors or very little risk factors,"" Dr. Al-Aly said, adding that new diagnoses are happening even in young adults with a healthy weight and no previous history of high blood sugar.,Maren Laughlin, a program director at the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said the study was very well done. Its main limitation, she noted, is that VA patients generally tend to be older and sicker and include more males than the broader population.,It hasn't been determined why a Covid-19 infection might be leading to new cases of diabetes. One possibility is that the virus might damage the pancreas's ability to secrete insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar. Another theory is that the strong immune response to Covid-19 generates an inflammatory cascade that results in low-grade inflammation, which interferes with insulin secretion and sensitivity.,
      A man measures his blood sugar.
      ,All types of diabetes share the symptom of high blood sugars, but they are distinct conditions. Type 2 is the most common, and can be associated with diet and exercise. Typically in Type 2, people become resistant to the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar. The pancreas struggles to keep up with the body's increased demand for insulin, leading to higher blood-sugar levels.,Type 1, by contrast, is an autoimmune disease in which the body destroys pancreatic cells that produce insulin. Other types of diabetes include gestational diabetes, which can develop in pregnant women.,The latest study follows other recent research that has found an increased risk of a diabetes diagnosis after a Covid-19 infection, including a January Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report looking at children.,In a March study in the journal Diabetologia, German researchers found that people who had Covid-19 had a roughly 28% increased risk of a new Type 2 diagnosis compared to those who had an acute upper-respiratory infection that wasn't Covid-19. The researchers compared data from more than 35,000 Covid-19 patients to an equal number of people with infections that weren't Covid-19. They didn't find an increased risk for other types of diabetes.,And a February JAMA Network Open study found that people who tested positive for Covid-19 had roughly a two times greater risk of a new Type 2 diagnosis one to five months after their infection compared to those who tested negative for the virus. About 7% of hospitalized adults with Covid-19 received new diabetes diagnoses within five months, compared to 3.6% of adults without Covid-19.,There are many challenges in interpreting the data, says Jason Block, an internal-medicine physician and associate professor at Harvard Medical School who is senior author of the JAMA study. Many people hadn't been to see a doctor for a while during the pandemic, so they might have had diabetes without knowing it. In addition, steroids -- a commonly used medication for severe Covid-19 patients -- can temporarily increase blood sugar and might also trigger diabetes in patients at risk for the condition.,There are several possible biological reasons why a diabetes diagnosis might follow a Covid-19 infection. Research has indicated that the virus can infect and damage beta cells in the pancreas so that they produce less insulin.,In one study, researchers found that when they added the coronavirus to beta cell samples, genetic changes occurred in the cells that significantly reduced their ability to make insulin. Instead, to the researchers' surprise, the cells did something unusual: They started making a different hormone, glucagon, whose function is to increase blood-glucose levels.,""The beta cells lost their cell identity and turned into a different type of cell,"" says Shuibing Chen, director of the diabetes program at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, who led the study.,Dr. Chen says Covid-19 infection appears to be triggering a new type of diabetes that isn't Type 1 or Type 2. Dr. Chen says her team is studying treatments specifically for Covid-19 patients newly diagnosed with diabetes to see whether they can block the process by which the cells might change.,Stanford researchers in an August study published in the journal Cell Metabolism documented another possible clue to post-Covid-19 diabetes. Lab studies found that the virus selectively targeted beta cells in the pancreas.,""It reduced their viability pretty quickly and reduced their ability to secrete insulin in less than a day,"" says Peter Jackson, a professor in the microbiology and immunology department at Stanford University School of Medicine, and senior author on the study. ""It's a strong effect."""

None of the House or Senate members who have contracted COVID in the recent wave have died — although late Rep. Ron Wright, R-Tex., passed after contracting COVID-19 early last year. Congressman-elect Luke Letlow, D-La., died form COVID complications in late 2020 — before he could even take office.,That said, the sheer number of COVID cases on Capitol Hill is eye-popping.,All told, at this writing, 135 members of the 117th Congress have tested positive.,Seventy-eight members have tested positive this calendar year.,The coronavirus , on Capitol Hill often matches — or even predicts — a wave in the general population. After all, we have ""representative government"" in the United States. And it seems that Congress has mostly aligned perfectly with the rest of the country as the pandemic endures peaks and valleys.,Such was the case when omicron struck late last year and the national COVID figures exploded. Congress witnessed a significant explosion of cases in December and January.,Then cases began to diminish as omicron waned. ,However, COVID cases on Capitol Hill recently soared, starting around March 1.,March 1 was the day of President Biden’s State of the Union speech at the Capitol. It was also the same day Washington, D.C., began to ease its own mandates. Under the Constitution, Congress makes its own rules. So none of the COVID protocols in the District of Columbia affected Congress. However, D.C.’s decision to back off restrictions made it easier for Congress to do the same.,

      ,You’ll see fewer members, aides, journalists and police officers , masks at the Capitol. More members conduct their business in person. Schools began to go on spring break. The Capitol began to reopen to limited, scheduled tours — mostly for school groups. Each office was then allowed to bring an expanded group of tourists, constituents or visitors through the Capitol on a regular basis.,The Capitol isn’t throbbing with waves of tourists like it did in the pre-pandemic period. But it’s a little shocking to see so many visitors pulsing through the building after a two-year hiatus. Some of those numbers are up right now because school is out. It’s spring break. People have traveled to Washington to see the cherry blossoms or are on the road for Easter and Passover. But more people in the Capitol — non-socially distanced and most without masks — may contribute to higher COVID numbers.,That said, there are no moves — yet — to dial back a partial reopening of the Capitol, even as cases rise.,The numbers really started to spike around April 5. Since then, 18 have tested positive.,Plus, there’s a big focus now on the exclusive Gridiron Dinner in Washington, a swanky, closed-door affair where the city’s elite dine, hobnob and guffaw at skits that make light of inside the Beltway politics.,But the gala for Washington power brokers appears to have devolved into a white-tie, super-spreader for power brokers.,The cozy confab may have fueled a capital, coronavirus crush.,In an email to its members, the Gridiron says with 80 positive tests, ""the connection between a new positive dinner and our dinner is certainly arguable, particularly for public officials who have had a full week of public events."",Call this the ""Tuxedo Variant?"",Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo tested ,.

(Another analysis attempted to assess ""duration of continuous symptoms,"" or potentially ""stronger evidence"" backing long COVID incidence, versus any symptom reported at any time post-infection, though data were missing for control participants by age.),""Because of the observational nature of this analysis, it is not possible to say with certainty whether symptoms reported after a positive test for coronavirus were caused by COVID-19 or something else,"" authors noted."

"‘Special Report’ anchor Bret Baier delivers the timeline of how U.S. government officials responded to information about coronavirus origins.,Fresh questions are being raised about what American scientists and federal health officials knew about the origins of the , and whether conflicting evidence was suppressed and hidden from the public.,On Tuesday night’s episode of Special Report with Bret Baier, Fox News dove into the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and explored documents obtained showing that , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was warned early on that the virus may have originated in a Wuhan, China lab.,According to the timeline of events laid out by Baier, Fauci was told on January 27, 2020 that his NIAID had been indirectly funding the Wuhan lab through EcoHealth-- a US-based scientific non-profit that had been working with novel coronaviruses.,
      Dr. Anthony Fauci testifies before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee about the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic on Capitol Hill on Nov. 4, 2021.
      ,On January 31, Dr. Kristian Andersen, a noted virologist at the Scripps Lab, privately told Fauci that after discussion with his colleagues some of COVID-19’s features look possibly engineered and the ""genome is inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory."",Andersen added that the situation needed to be looked at more closely, at which point Fauci organized an all hands on deck conference call with colleagues where he was told that risky experiments with the novel coronavirus may not have gone through proper biosafety review and oversight. ,Hours later, Fauci hastily organized a call with dozens of worldwide virologists, and notes from the meeting obtained by Special Report reveal that suspicions of the lab leak theory were suppressed over concerns of how the public would react to news of possible Chinese government involvement. ,In the meeting, fears were raised by then-National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins that ""science and international harmony"" could be harmed and accusations of China’s involvement could distract top researchers. ,Another scientist in the meeting dismissed the possibility that the virus jumped from a bat to a person in nature and pointed out that the virus could be generated in a lab much easier.,Fauci and others in the meeting pointed to evidence that the virus originated in a seafood and wild animal market in Wuhan, which was complicated by the market being shut down and scrubbed clean by Chinese authorities.,A consensus was reached in the call that the lab origin should not be mentioned in a paper because it will add ""fuel to the conspiracists,"" and Collins appeared convinced that natural origin of the virus was ""more likely."",
      Francis Collins, director, National Institutes of Health, speaks at the Milken Institute 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, April 30, 2018.
      ,Just four days later, five researchers who were on the call authored preliminary findings abandoning their early private beliefs that the virus was likely the result of a lab leak. ,It is unclear what new evidence prompted the reversal of opinion, but private communications show that various drafts were sent to Fauci and Collins for approval. ,The first public draft was published on February 16 but failed to tamp down theories that the virus originated in a lab. ,Over the next few months, Fauci and Collins worked behind the scenes to squash the lab leak theory and communicated to each other the day after President Trump declined to dismiss the wet market theory, discussing ""something NIH can do to help put down this very destructive conspiracy."",The email from Collins to Fauci contains a link to a Special Report segment on the issue, and Fauci urged Collins to ignore the story, referring to it as a ""shiny object that will go away."",

      , ,The death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined. It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, COVID-19 is now the third-leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke. ,The staggering figure is almost certainly an undercount because of limited testing and people dying at home without medical attention, especially in poor parts of the world, such as India. ,Hot spots have shifted over the 22 months since the outbreak began, turning different places on the world map red. Now, ,, ,, especially where rumors, misinformation and distrust in government have hobbled vaccination efforts. In Ukraine, only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated; in Armenia, only 7%. ,""What’s uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries,"" said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University. ""That’s the irony of COVID-19."" ,Wealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus. ,India, despite its terrifying delta surge that peaked in early May, now has a much lower reported daily death rate than wealthier Russia, the U.S. or Britain, though there is uncertainty around its figures. ,The seeming disconnect between wealth and health is a paradox that disease experts will be pondering for years. But the pattern that is seen on the grand scale, when nations are compared, is different when examined at closer range. Within each wealthy country, when deaths and infections are mapped, poorer neighborhoods are hit hardest. ,In the U.S., for example, COVID-19 has taken an outsize toll on Black and Hispanic people, who are more likely than White people to live in poverty and have less access to health care. ,""When we get out our microscopes, we see that within countries, the most vulnerable have suffered most,"" Ko said. ,Wealth has also played a role in the global vaccination drive, with rich countries accused of locking up supplies. The U.S. and others are already dispensing booster shots at a time when millions ,, though the rich countries are also shipping hundreds of millions of shots to the rest of the world. ,Africa remains the world’s ,, with just 5% of the population of 1.3 billion people fully covered. ,In Kampala, Uganda, Cissy Kagaba lost her 62-year-old mother on Christmas Day and her 76-year-old father days later. ,

The responsibility is on me. COVID has changed my life,"" said 32-year-old Reena Kesarwani, a mother of two boys, who was left to manage her late husband’s modest hardware store in a village in India. ,Her husband, Anand Babu Kesarwani, died at 38 during India's crushing coronavirus surge earlier this year. It overwhelmed one of the most chronically underfunded public health systems in the world and killed tens of thousands as hospitals ran out of oxygen and medicine. ,In Bergamo, Italy, once the site of the West’s first deadly wave, 51-year-old Fabrizio Fidanza was deprived of a final farewell as his 86-year-old father lay dying in the hospital.

Washington state is requiring all teachers and school personnel to be fully vaccinated by an October deadline or face possible firing. Elsewhere, the topic of how to safely return to school remains a hot topic of debate. ,In New York for instance, the state has left it up to individual school districts to create their own plans. Several schools have decided to mandate masks, while others have chosen to ""recommend but not require"" them. In Florida, the state’s board of education voted to sanction two districts who defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order banning mask mandates in schools. ,In Arkansas, where schools reopened last week and there is a law banning masks, over 800 students and staff had to enter quarantine because of COVID-19 exposure.  ,""There are many children and others who cannot be vaccinated,"" said Sara Bode, MD, FAAP, chair-person elect of the AAP Council on School Health Executive Committee. ""This is why it’s important to use every tool in our toolkit to safeguard children from COVID-19. Universal masking is one of those tools, and has been proven effective in protecting people against other respiratory diseases, as well. It’s also the most effective strategy to create consistent messages and expectations among students without the added burden of needing to monitor everyone’s vaccination status."""

As of Sept. 6, deaths in age groups under 24 comprised 0.6% of all COVID-related deaths reported worldwide. Younger age groups can experience lingering symptoms after infection, or so-called ""long COVID,"" however ongoing research is looking into its frequency and characteristics, as well as a rare, COVID-related inflammatory condition in children, according to the WHO.,At least 42% of the global population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly 32 million doses are administered each day, per the latest figures from ,, whereas 74% of all Americans ages 12 and up, or eligible for vaccine, have received at least one dose, with over 63% fully vaccinated, according to the , (CDC).,Over the last week the head of the ,, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called on rich countries with large supplies of ,to refrain from offering booster shots through the end of the year, expanding a call that has largely fallen on deaf ears.

      ,The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, (VRBPAC) was charged with voting whether available data supported the safety and effectiveness of a 50 microgram booster dose among three high risk groups: ,Dr. Jacqueline Miller, infectious diseases therapeutic area head at Moderna, presented company findings among some 344 participants indicating the booster shot failed to meet FDA criteria by a narrow margin; the shot didn’t result in a four-fold increased immune response, likely due to high protection afforded from the primary series, though recipients still benefited from the shot. More specifically, Moderna officials explained that participants’ immune systems were likely impacted by the presence of pre-existing antibodies.,The booster did result in a 42-fold increase in antibody levels against the highly transmissible delta variant, with mostly mild-to-moderate side effects. The most common side effects included injection site pain, headache, fatigue and myalgia. Miller concluded the 50 microgram booster dose could address waning antibody levels and reduce breakthrough infections tied to the delta variant. ,Following the panel’s decision, voting member Dr. Patrick Moore weighed in, adding in part: ""I’ve got some real issues with this vote … The data itself is not strong but it is certainly going in a direction that is supportive of this vote."",Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, noted that the vaccines still offer strong protection against serious outcomes, however vaccine effectiveness against mild-to-moderate disease appears to wane over time, and complications from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease may include blood clots and long COVID-19. ,Data from Israel’s rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot were also presented during the meeting, with findings indicating improved protection against severe disease among individuals ages 40 and older, and enhanced protection against confirmed infection among people ages 16 and older. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, public health services director at Israel’s Health Ministry, said the country is experiencing a break in the pandemic curve, and she cited the Pfizer booster shot in helping the country overcome a fourth COVID-19 wave by easing hospital burden and severe disease. ,However, some FDA advisers cautioned over extrapolating data from other countries. ,In a following discussion about potentially expanding booster shot eligibility to the general population ages 18 and older, at least six committee members opposed the idea and several called for benefit-risk considerations."

While protection dropped against infections, it remained effective in preventing hospitalizations. ,Gruber cited evidence suggesting reductions in efficacy owed to waning immunity over time as opposed to the delta variant escaping vaccine protection. Additional data suggested a third Pfizer dose would ramp up protection on par or better than the second dose, however concerns were raised over the potential increased risk of myocarditis. The FDA panel's review included Pfizer's trial results with some 300 participants ages 18-55 who received a booster dose about six months after the second dose.,To be clear, the role of the FDA and advisory panel in this case is to determine whether an additional dose can be used, whereas an expert panel advising the CDC (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP), will convene Wednesday to weigh who should receive vaccine and when, following the FDA's final review.

Nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the origin of the virus tormenting the world remains shrouded in mystery.
      ,Some supporters of the lab-leak hypothesis have theorized that researchers were accidentally exposed because of inadequate safety practices while working with samples from the wild, or perhaps after creating the virus in the laboratory. U.S. intelligence officials have rejected suspicions China developed the virus as a bioweapon.,The continuing search for answers has inflamed tensions between the U.S. and China, which has accused the U.S. of making it the scapegoat for the disaster. Some experts fear the pandemic’s origins may never be known.,FROM BATS TO PEOPLE,Scientists said in the Cell paper that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is the ninth documented coronavirus to infect humans. All previous ones originated in animals.,That includes the virus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic, which also has been associated with markets selling live animals in China.,Many researchers believe wild animals were intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, meaning they were infected with a bat coronavirus that then evolved. Scientists have been looking for the exact bat coronavirus involved, and in September identified three viruses in bats in Laos more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than any known viruses.,Worobey suspects raccoon dogs were the intermediate host. The fox-like mammals are susceptible to coronaviruses and were being sold live at the Huanan market, he said.,""The gold-standard piece of evidence for an animal origin"" would be an infected animal from there, Goldstein said. ""But as far as we know, the market was cleared out."",Earlier this year, a joint report by the , and China called the transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal the most likely scenario and a lab leak ""extremely unlikely."",But that report also sowed doubt by pegging the first known COVID-19 case as an accountant who had no connection to the Huanan market and first showed symptoms on Dec. 8, 2019. Worobey said proponents of the lab-leak theory point to that case in claiming the virus escaped from a Wuhan Institute of Virology facility near where the man lived.,According to Worobey’s research, however, the man said in an interview that his Dec. 8 illness was actually a dental problem, and his COVID-19 symptoms began on Dec. 16, a date confirmed in ,.,Worobey’s analysis identifies an earlier case: a vendor in the Huanan market who came down with COVID-19 on Dec. 11.,ANIMAL THREATS,Experts worry the same sort of animal-to-human transmission of viruses could spark new pandemics — and worsen this one.,Since COVID-19 emerged, many types of animals have gotten infected, including pet cats, dogs and ferrets; zoo animals such as big cats, otters and non-human primates; farm-raised mink; and white-tailed deer.,Most got the virus from people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says that humans can spread it to animals during close contact but that the risk of animals transmitting it to people is low.,Another fear, however, is that animals could unleash new viral variants. Some wonder if the omicron variant began this way.,""Around the world, we might have animals potentially incubating these variants even if we get (COVID-19) under control in humans,"" said David O’Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""We’re probably not going to do a big giraffe immunization program any time soon."",Worobey said he has been looking for genetic fingerprints that might indicate whether omicron was created when the virus jumped from humans to an animal, mutated, and then leaped back to people.,Experts say preventing zoonotic disease will require not only cracking down on illegal wildlife sales but making progress on big global problems that increase risky human-animal contact, such as habitat destruction and climate change.,Failing to fully investigate the animal origin of the virus, scientists said in the Cell paper, ""would leave the world vulnerable to future pandemics arising from the same human activities that have repeatedly put us on a collision course with novel viruses."",‘TOXIC’ POLITICS,But further investigation is stymied by superpower politics.

The unrelenting momentum of the STD epidemic continued even as STD prevention services were disrupted."" Dr. Jonathan Mermin, the director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, said in the CDC release.,The report stated that the number of reported cases of gonorrhea was up 10%, while primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis was up 7%, compared to 2019. Congenital syphilis also increased by 15% from 2019 and 235% compared to 2016, the federal health agency said. The CDC stated that early data revealed that primary and secondary syphilis and congenital syphilis cases also continued to rise in 2021.,
      Cases of several sexually transmitted diseases rose during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic, according to a CDC report.
      ,The federal health agency said the 2020 STD data showed the groups that continued to experience higher rates of STDs included young Americans; gay and bisexual men; and some racial and ethnic minority groups. The CDC found lack of access to consistent medical care, stigma and discrimination as possible reasons contributing to this trend.,""The COVID-19 pandemic increased awareness of a reality we’ve long known about STDs. Social and economic factors – such as poverty and health insurance status – create barriers, increase health risks, and often result in worse health outcomes for some people,"" Dr. Leandro Mena, the director of the CDC’s Division of STD Prevention, said in the release. ""If we are to make lasting progress against STDs in this country, we have to understand the systems that create inequities and work with partners to change them. No one can be left behind."",While many sexually transmitted diseases increased, the number of reported cases of chlamydia decreased by 13% from 2019, according to the report.

"Paul Gigot interviews Dr. Marty Makary,Katrina Haydon can’t eat, shower or brush her teeth the same way she used to six months ago because of parosmia, a smell disorder sometimes associated with , ""long-haulers,"" or people whose COVID symptoms last long after they test positive for the virus.,Parosmia is a term used for any kind of distortion of one’s sense of smell — unlike anosmia, a term for one’s loss of their sense of smell.,For Haydon, 24, it started with anosmia. She believes she contracted COVID-19 in June of 2021, though she tested negative for the virus. She had mild cold-like symptoms and lost her sense of taste and smell, as many COVID patients do. The anosmia lasted for several weeks before about 70% to 80% of her taste and smell senses returned.,

Chemical cleaner and perfume smell like really sharp, overwhelming sulfur — like the smell of hair burning but concentrated and stronger. Sweets and dairy taste like perfume would taste if you sprayed it in your mouth,"" she told Fox News.,Haydon’s aversion to the smell of heat — such as the smell of a hot shower or radiator — is perhaps the strangest aspect of her condition.,""I used to take a shower more than twice a day regularly, but at least twice a day, and it has been really, really hard for me to make myself shower once a day. It's so difficult,"" she said. ""And same thing with brushing my teeth. It’s really, really hard because even non-mint toothpastes cause a physical reaction because they just taste and smell so bad."",

      ,The experience has been isolating and even depressing.,If her neighbors cook, it smells bad. Public transportation smells bad (or at least worse than normal). CVS and Whole Foods smell bad. Restaurants smell terrible. It has driven her away from seeing friends in social settings.,""I think everybody believes me, but I don't think they realize — I think a lot of people don't realize — the severity of it,"" Haydon said. ""It seems like, oh, everything smells and tastes bad, that stinks, but I don’t think the extent to which it does change your day-to-day life is immediately evident to most people. I think it takes a little time to understand what that really does look like."",Dr. Andrew Lane, Director of the Sinus Center at Johns Hopkins and professor of otolaryngology — head and neck surgery — at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told Fox News that parosmia not only appears in some COVID-19 survivors, but it can also occur after people catch other viral infections or suffer brain injuries, brain tumors and Multiple Sclerosis.,Lane, who is , the phenomenon in COVID-19 survivors, says it all starts in membranes located in the upper part of a person’s nose. ,""Your whole nose is lined with mucous membranes ... and in the upper part of the nose, there's a very specialized mucous membrane where you sense smells. This is really a unique kind of tissue in the body,"" he said. ""For one thing, it's the only place in the body where a neuron that's coming from the brain directly contacts the outside world … The part of this neuron that is sticking out into the environment is what actually detects odor molecules. … And then it sends a signal straight to the brain."",
      Dr. Andrew Lane (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine)
      ,That unique tissue is called the olfactory epithelium. The membranes in that part of the nose remember what certain objects are supposed to smell like. ,But with anosmia and parosmia, those neurons, which are supposed to send signals to the brain after encountering an odor molecule and inform the brain of what it is, get lost along the way.,COVID has a peculiar ability to infect and severely damage the olfactory epithelium … if you lose a lot of neurons, sort of all at once, you may become anosmic,"" Lane explained, adding that ""the neurons will usually grow back and find their way to right place in the brain, although it’s not exactly clear how this happens.,His recent study shows that COVID-19 cells, which latch onto and infect olfactory cells, are 700 times more prevalent in the upper part of the nose that send odor signals to the brain than they are in ""the lining cells of the rest of the nose and windpipe that leads to the lungs."",Usually, a person’s sense of smell returns quickly after contracting COVID-19, but sometimes it can take months; in rare cases, people can lose their smell indefinitely. ,

      ,When a person experiences anosmia, sometimes they can gain their sense of smell back by smelling potent foods, like grapefruit, because the brain can remember how those foods are supposed to smell. ,But with parosmia, neurons send the ""wrong"" signals to the brain, which is why Haydon and others can’t eat or walk into restaurants — because everything smells too awful.,Lane says as devastating as this is for most people who experience it, it’s actually a good sign.,""That often means that it's coming back,"" the professor said, ""The sense of smell is starting to work again, and while there may be some sorting out to do, at least the elements are finding their way back together, getting some signal to your brain when your nose smells something, which is better than no sensation. … If the brain can sort it out over time, you have a better chance of getting a normal sense of smell back."",Haydon has turned to online forums, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter to find answers because doctors haven’t given her much to work with.,There are a mix of people experiencing the issue: young people, older people, men, women, vaccinated, unvaccinated. Many say they experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms before suddenly experiencing parosmia weeks or months after contracting the virus. She’s read about parents who can’t cook for their families anymore or sit with them at the dinner table.,Yet for such a debilitating issue for potentially thousands of people, if not millions, globally, there is no confirmed solution.,

      ,Haydon has read about solutions ranging from alpha-lipoic, an antioxidant found naturally in human cells, to IV drips, zinc and even chiropractic methods.,""It's pretty varied,"" she said. ""Mostly, it's people saying, ‘Have you tried this? Have you tried this?’ But most of the people I see that say, ‘Oh, I did this, and it worked,’ is the alpha-lipoic."",Lane said he’s heard of using alpha-lipoic acid as a solution, but ""there’s not very good evidence that [it] works."",""I mean, there's a whole industry of different things offered to people for olfactory loss, and unfortunately it is mostly snake oil kind of stuff with very skimpy supporting data,"" he said. ""While some people report improvement with various dietary supplements, it is hard to know whether the same recovery would have happened without it.  The bottom line is, at this time, there is no medication we have that restores a sense of smell."",Ultimately, COVID-19 is too new. It’s only been around for about two years, so ""long"" COVID symptoms and long-term effects of the virus are still largely unknown.,Most of the patients Lane sees who can’t taste food or experience a bad reaction to the smell of food have to force themselves to eat because they know they’re hungry even though the act of eating seems unappealing. ,""It's a frustrating problem that we don't have a treatment for,"" he explained. ""And I think because of COVID we're going to see more and more patients with parosmia. The answer, ultimately, is going to be research. … We've been interested in this kind of general problem of how the sense of smell works and what can go wrong with it. But with the growing numbers of people suffering from post-COVID olfactory problems, I think that there is a more urgent need for a better understanding of the damage the virus does to the olfactory system so we can develop treatments that help it to repair itself."""
